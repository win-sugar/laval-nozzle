
this repository contain OpenFOAM data to simuate laval nozzle flow.
three cases, shown below, are included:

- pe089 : pe/p0=0.89
- pe075 : pe/p0=0.75
- pe016 : pe/p0=0.16

where pe is pressure at the exit and p0 is total pressure (at the inlet).
also, included are several julia program to calculate flow quantities.
